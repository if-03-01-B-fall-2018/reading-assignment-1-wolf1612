Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information</strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. What does <!DOCTYPE` html> mean?</strong></h3>
<p> Awnser: The < !DOCTYPE > declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. ... HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.</p>
